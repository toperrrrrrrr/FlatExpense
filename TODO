layout




register 
Should clear the data after submission to preven resubmission of data to mysql 
I should also connect the static js to the backend js to pass variables around.
// not used at the moment. I will get back to this next time to validate data before sending it to the back end



Create a chat function using realtime database functions of MYSQL or alternatively we can implement firebase for data redundancy 


make this opensource so people can use this. 
I believe this will be better if I make this an android app instead since my target users are android users.


restructure the directories, separate the frontend to back end and the shared files between them.
