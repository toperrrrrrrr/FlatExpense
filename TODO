NOTES TO SELF

Work on contributions page, 

make it so that it is possible to delete one record base on ID. 

404.ejs
This page needs to be updated and make the layout more responsive

user - register 
create proper registration form
sql, add access level 
Super user got access level 100. Admin - 99, admin can access more than other users. 
super user can access all users and functions
super user can do the delete.
admin can access almost all functions.
create user validation. Whether the username already exist and whether the password is correct.
we can also implement password reset function
change password
Chatting system. 

main - menu
layout


register 
Should clear the data after submission to prevent resubmission of data to mysql 
I should also connect the static js to the backend js to pass variables around.
// not used at the moment. I will get back to this next time to validate data before sending it to the back end


Foods
create
read 
update
delete



Create a chat function using realtime database functions of MYSQL or alternatively we can implement firebase for data redundancy 


make this opensource so people can use this. 
I believe this will be better if I make this an android app instead since my target users are android users.


restructure the directories, separate the frontend to back end and the shared files between them. 


Prevent form and backend calls to go off whenever the page is reloaded.
